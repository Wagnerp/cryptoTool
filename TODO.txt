Need to make the encryption tool general purpose for all encryption algorithms supported by .NET and otherwise. Link the comboBox to each algorithm available (or better yet, create a set of listBoxes so one or multiple encryption methods could be selected.)

Allow for a user inputted password to generate the key. The key can be generated by hashing the password by itself or by adding a salt (a padding). Maybe have the salt be an option selected via checkBox.

Allow for the user to save the key in a file for later use.

***Be able to handle file type other than just plain text. I think the key to doing this is by using a different encoding than ASCII when reading in those type of files.
