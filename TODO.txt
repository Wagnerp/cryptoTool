Need to make the encryption tool general purpose for all encryption algorithms supported by .NET and otherwise. Link the comboBox to each algorithm available (or better yet, create a set of listBoxes so one or multiple encryption methods could be selected.)

Allow for a user inputted password to generate the key. The key can be generated by hashing the password by itself or by adding a salt (a padding). Maybe have the salt be an option selected via checkBox.

Allow for the user to save the key in a file for later use.

Use the EncryptionMethod enumerator to determine which algorithm to use. may be able to associate symmetric and assymetric with the enumerator values. Also use it to determine the number of bytes needed to generate a byte array for the password method (line 148 in MainWindow.cs).
